#+TITLE: Installation notes for working with pybind11/eigen


* Install eigen into conda env

wget http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.2.8.tar.bz2

Untar, then move header directory into conda env:

mv -vi Eigen $CONDA_ENV_PATH/include

Eigen is header-only so that's it.

Except!  For various tools to find it, also need to:

touch $CONDA_ENV_PATH/include/signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library


* Install pybind11

** Prerequisites

conda install cmake

To get latest version.

** PyBind itself

wget https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/archive/v1.8.tar.gz

Untar, then

cmake .
make -j 4
make test

All passed.

Make headers available:

ln -s ~/dev/tar/pybind11-1.8/include/pybind11 $CONDA_ENV_PATH/include

PyBind11 is header-only so that's it.
